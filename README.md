FenwickTree
===========

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/mgajda/FenwickTree.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mgajda/FenwickTree)

Fenwick trees are a O(log N) data structure for updating cumulative sums.
This implementation comes with an operation to find a least element for
which real-valued cumulative sum reaches certain value, and allows for
storage of arbitrary information in the nodes.

See [description on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree).

Official releases are on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hPDB).

This package is also a part of [Stackage](http://daniel-diaz.github.io/stackagelist/)
- a stable subset of Hackage.
